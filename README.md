***Maven Hospital Challenge***



Creating a Hospital Challenge Report involves several key steps in Power BI :

 **Data Collection**

- Gather data from various sources such as sales records, order details, and customer information.

 **Data Preparation**

- Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. This includes handling missing values, correcting errors, and normalizing data formats. I create a date table to addmit_date for data normalizing.

-  **Data Modeling**

- Establish relationships between different data tables. Create calculated columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to perform necessary calculations.

**Creating Visualizations**

- Use Power BI's visual tools to create charts, graphs, maps, bar charts, pie charts, and slicers.

 **Dashboard Layout**
- Arrange the visualizations on the dashboard for a clear and intuitive layout. Group related metrics and ensure the most critical information is easily accessible.
**Adding Filters and Slicers**
- Add interactive filters and slicers to allow users to drill down into the data, such as by date range or product category.
**Testing and Validation**
- Validate the dashboard by comparing the visualized data with the raw data to ensure accuracy. Test the interactivity and responsiveness of the dashboard.
 **Deployment**
- Publish the dashboard to the Power BI service to share it with stakeholders. Set up access controls and permissions as needed.
